# Autonomous-door-
An autonomous door lock that uses face recognition to grant access to guests is a great way to enhance security.

The components that were used in the Project are:
	• ESP32 - built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, which makes it easy to connect to the internet and other devices.

	• Raspberry Pi 4 -  powerful single-board computer that can handle image processing tasks using OpenCV2. It's a good choice for running the face recognition algorithm and controlling the servo motor.

	• OpenCV2: This is an open-source computer vision library that provides tools for image and video processing. It's a good choice for implementing the face recognition algorithm and detecting faces in the video stream from the PiCam.
	
	• PiCam:  is a camera module that can be connected to the Raspberry Pi. It's a good choice for capturing the video stream that will be processed by OpenCV2.
	
	• Servo Motor: This is a motor that can be controlled to move to a specific position. It's a good choice for controlling the lock mechanism of the door.
